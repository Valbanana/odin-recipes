    <h1>Tequeños</h1>

    <p>Ok, so I'm sure not everyone even knows what a tequeño is. Hell, until I discovered the gem that is Arepas Cafe in my hometown of Astoria, New York, many years ago, I had never heard of or seen one. But after one bite, I knew I could never live my life without them again.</p>
    <p>Basically, these things are Venezuelan fried cheese sticks, originating in the town of Los Teques. Think mozzarella stick, but replace the mozzarella with a squeaky and salty queso blanco, and sub out the breadcrumb coating for a pastry-like shell. Sounds pretty amazing, right?</p>
    <p>They're so good that I felt I'd be doing a disservice to the full tequeño experience if I didn't go back and fix the flaws of my initial recipe, which had a crust that lacked the blistery appearance and rich flavor it should have, as well as problems with cheesy explosions that seeped out of the dough while frying.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces all-purpose flour (about 2 cups)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons cold butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons cold water, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>12 ounces queso blanco or queso de frier, cut into slices 1/2-inch x 1/2-inch x 2 1/2-inch</li>
        <li>Oil of your choice, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place flour and salt in workbowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade; pulse to combine. Sprinkle butter evenly over flour and pulse until butter is cut into pieces slightly smaller than a pea, about 8 one-second pulses. Transfer dough to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add in egg and water. Using a rubber spatula, press dough against side of bowl until it forms a ball. If dough is not fully forming, add additional water one tablespoon at a time until it comes together. Press dough into a disc, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and rest in refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Unwrap dough and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll out into a square 1/8-inch thick. Cut off edges to create a 12-inch square. Cut square into 14 strips, each 3/4-inch wide.</li>
        <li>Take one strip of dough and drape end over top of one cheese slice. Wrap entire cheese slice in dough on a diagonal, overlapping dough. Cover bottom of cheese slice in dough and pinch edges close to fully seal. Repeat with remaining cheese slices.</li>
        <li>Fill a cast iron skillet with 3/4-inch of oil. Heat oil to 400°F (204°C) over high heat. Place tequeños in oil and fry until crust is golden brown and blistery, 3 to 5 minutes, turning halfway through. Transfer tequeños to a paper towel-lined plate, let cool for 1 to 2 minutes, then serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
